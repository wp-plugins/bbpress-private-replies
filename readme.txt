A simple plugin to allow your bbPress users to mark their replies as private.

== Description ==

This add-on plugin for bbPress will allow your forum posters to mark their replies as private, meaning that only the original poster and forum moderators can see the content of the reply. This is a great plugin to install if you use bbPress as a support forum where users may need to share confidential information, such as site URLs, passwords, etc.
